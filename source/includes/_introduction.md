# Introduction

Welcome to the Load Order Library API. Here you can learn how to use the API to request a list of all non-private lists, get a specific one, and do list comparisons. The intended purpose of this API, in addition to powering the main site itself, is to allow 3rd party tools such as the Ultimate Skyrim launcher to be able to upload lists and compare them to help support in identifying issues.
